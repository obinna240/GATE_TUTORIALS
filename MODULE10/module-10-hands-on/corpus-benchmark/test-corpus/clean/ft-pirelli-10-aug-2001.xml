<TextWithNodes><Node id="0" />A dispute is brewing between Pirelli and the board of Telecom Italia, the telecommunications group it took control of a week ago, over a proposed E15.5m ($13.8m) payout to Roberto Colaninno, the ousted Telecom Italia chief executive.

Pirelli revealed it had agreed with the investors who sold it control of Olivetti - Telecom Italia's holding company - that Olivetti and Telecom Italia "will approve" paying Mr Colaninno E15.5m each.

But when the Telecom Italia payment of E15.5m was proposed last week, its board rejected it. Pirelli and its ally, the Benetton family, gained control on July 28 by buying 23 per cent of Olivetti from Bell, an investment group headed by Mr Colaninno and others. The E31m payouts would be in lieu of options and any other compensation due to him. Mr Colaninno was also chief executive of Olivetti.

Several board members objected that Telecom Italia shares had not risen since Mr Colaninno took control and that the figure was too high.

Mr Colaninno had a salary last year of E3.5m from Telecom Italia and E819,000 from Olivetti. He also had cash bonuses of E3.6m from Telecom Italia and E700,000 from Olivetti and other companies controlled by Olivetti.

In addition, he received options to buy 12.6m Olivetti shares between 2002 and 2004 at E2.81 a share. Olivetti shares on Thursday closed at E1.94 compared with the E4.17 - an 80 per cent premium to the market - paid by Pirelli and the Benetton family when they bought their controlling stake. The shares fell when investors realised they would not benefit from a takeover.

Pirelli is expected to bring in a new board this autumn but several members are likely to object again to the payment. The Olivetti board might approve its E15.5m payout but minority shareholders in both companies may also object.<Node id="1796" /></TextWithNodes>
